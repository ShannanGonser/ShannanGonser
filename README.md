I love learning and most of all doing the thing ie bringing the "thing(s)" to life!

I'm not afraid to "mess up" (loops back to learning process). 

I enjoy working with visuals a lot!

Lastly, you know I've always wanted to learn a language or two and life priorities changed like so where
I am doing such in a way that is better than I imagined! 
Initially my thought process was something along the lines of French, Mandarin, or Japanese.
My priorities lead down a slightly different path learning programming languages, very pleased!
(Still plan on learning another human language though)
